# Majitsu
## What is this?
It's a WIP porcelain for the amazing 'Jujutsu' VC.
## Why?
I've always admired Magit, and seeing as I've switched to JJ I thought I might try and learn some lisp while making my own. I'm not sure how production ready it will get at this stage, but so far I have been using an earlier prototype at work with some success!
